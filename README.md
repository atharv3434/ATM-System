# ATM-System

Description
This ATM System is a Java-based console application that simulates an automated teller machine (ATM). It allows users to perform various banking operations such as withdrawal, deposit, balance inquiry, and PIN verification. The system follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and utilizes Encapsulation to store and manage user details securely.

This system does not require a database; instead, it stores account details in memory and provides a menu-driven approach for user interaction.

✅ Features of the ATM System
✔ User Authentication – PIN verification before accessing account functions.
✔ Balance Inquiry – Displays the current account balance.
✔ Cash Withdrawal – Allows users to withdraw money if sufficient balance is available.
✔ Cash Deposit – Enables users to deposit money into their account.
✔ PIN Change – Allows users to update their ATM PIN securely.
